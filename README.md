# Bhagavad_Gita_Dataset_from_API

## Summary

Getting the data in a structured and desired format is one of the first and most important steps required for any data related domain, be it data engineering or data science. In this mini project I have used the ``Bhagavad Gita API`` from Rapid API website whcih is an open-source REST API that lets anyone use the text from Srimad Bhagavad Gita in their own web or mobile application(s).

After making request to the API and getting response in a ``.json`` format made transformations using ``pandas`` such as dropping unnecessary columns and renaming columns for better readability. You will find the code here -> bhagavad_gita_dataset.ipynb

And then dumped the dataframe in a ``csv`` file. The final dataframe looked something like this -> bhagavad_gita_eng.csv
